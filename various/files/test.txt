The name attribute reflects the name you passed in to the open() 
function when you opened the file. It is not normalized to an 
absolute pathname.
Likewise, encoding attribute reflects the encoding you passed 
in to the open() function. If you didn’t specify the encoding when 
you opened the file (bad developer!) then the encoding attribute 
will reflect locale.getpreferredencoding().
③	The mode attribute tells you in which mode the file was opened. 
You can pass an optional mode parameter to the open() function. 
You didn’t specify a mode when you opened this file, so Python 
defaults to 'r', which means “open for reading only, in text mode.” 
As you’ll see later in this chapter, the file mode serves several 
purposes; different modes let you write to a file, append to a 
file, or open a file in binary mode (in which you deal with bytes 
instead of strings).
